# Coding Challenges

This is a repository to store coding challenges and my solutions to them. I initially classified them as "easy/medium/hard" but this may change in the future.

### 🏁 Testing
For testing the challenges, I chose using Jest, since it is relly good at unitary tests.

You just need to use the command `npm run test <challengeName>`.

*E.G.* `npm run test romanToInt`
