# Coding Challenges

This is a repository to store coding challenges and my solutions to them.

I know it isn't recommended to add comments inside code because it should speak for itself, but I added anyways incase someones new reading this and don't get all methods or other things used.

### 🏁 Testing
For testing the challenges, I chose using Jest, since it is relly good at unitary tests.

You just need to use the command `npm run test <challengeName>`.

*E.G.* `npm run test romanToInt`
